VERSION 0.9.1:

    CHANGE: Remove unwanted extra frame height from node bottom

    CHANGE: Allow to specify if links of deleted node should also be automatically deleted
        Now it is possible to delete only node without automatically serving links,
        application can choose to do this operation by itself and for example
        short circuit flow links ot do any other special operation.

    CHANGE: Canvas: Allow to overlap canvas widget

    CHANGE: Natvis: Move crude_json natvis to separate file

    CHANGE: Natvis: Show readable NodeId/PinId/LinkId

    NEW: Make view state independent of window resolution.

    NEW: Editor can now break links connected specified node or pin
        New API:
        int BreakLinks(NodeId nodeId);
        int BreakLinks(PinId pinId);

    NEW: Editor can now tell if node or pin has any links attached
        New API:
        bool HasAnyLinks(NodeId nodeId);
        bool HasAnyLinks(PinId pinId);

    NEW: Editor can be queried if particular node or link is selected
        New API:
        bool IsNodeSelected(NodeId nodeId);
        bool IsLinkSelected(LinkId linkId);

    NEW: Editor now can return pins of the link
        New API:
        bool GetLinkPins(LinkId linkId, PinId* startPinId, PinId* endPinId);

        `startPinId` and `endPinId` may be null if caller is not interested
        in particular id.

    NEW: Editor now return ids of hovered node/pin/link
        New API:
        NodeId GetHoveredNode();
        PinId GetHoveredPin();
        LinkId GetHoveredLink();

    NEW: Add SetGroupSize() to explicitly set group size
        New API:
        void SetGroupSize(NodeId nodeId, const ImVec2& size);

    NEW: crude_json: Add save() and load()

        When CRUDE_JSON_IO == 1 value will have load() and save()
        function implemented using stdio.h FILE.

    NEW: crude_json: Add erase() and get_ptr()

    NEW: Application overhaul
        - Convert from function based to inheritable class
        - Add ability to close app and change title from code
        - Add ability to control main window flags (ex. show menubar)
        - Save ImGui state to ini file
        - Render using pre-multiplied alpha textures
        - Add extra fonts to examples.

    BUGFIX: Avoid crash while destroying editor.

    BUGFIX: Save draw list used by editor between Begin() and End()
        There is a chance ImGui::GetWindowDrawList() will return different draw list
        while nodes are being composed. To avoid troubles of manipulating incorrect
        draw list one obtained in Begin() is remembered and used.

    BUGFIX: Avoid division by zero in ImCubicBezierBoundingRect
